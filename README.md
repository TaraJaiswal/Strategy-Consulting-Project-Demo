# 🚀 Strategy Consulting Project Demo

Welcome to my strategy consulting project demo — a showcase of analytical, strategic, and research-based work developed through an immersive business simulation and real-world industry analysis. This project was focused on **Falcon**, a jetpack company, and explores competitive strategy using leading business frameworks and simulation tools.
