# Strategy-Consulting-Project-Demo
This is demo of my work & skills that I can publish on public platform
🧠 Analytical Thinking
I applied strategic frameworks like PESTLE, SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, and the Ansoff Matrix to deeply analyze Falcon’s internal and external environment. I interpreted data from the Hubro simulation and translated it into meaningful insights that shaped our recommendations.

📊 Research Skills
I conducted thorough secondary research using academic journals, market reports, and credible online sources. This helped me support my arguments with evidence and tailor strategies relevant to both the simulation and the real-world jetpack industry.

💡 Strategic Planning
I contributed to developing a business roadmap for Falcon that aligned with a cost leadership strategy. I used tools like Porter’s Generic Strategies and Bowman’s Strategy Clock to evaluate different strategic options and identify the most viable path forward.

📝 Business and Technical Writing
I was actively involved in drafting key sections of the report. I made sure the writing was clear, professional, and backed with appropriate references. I also helped organize the content into a logical structure, including the mission, vision, and values, as well as detailed analyses and appendices.

💻 Digital Literacy
I worked with Hubro simulation tools to analyze Falcon’s performance data. This allowed me to test strategic assumptions and better understand the financial and market dynamics in a simulated business environment.

📈 Marketing and Business Acumen
I evaluated competitor strategies and recognized opportunities where Falcon could leverage marketing to gain ground. I understood the role of brand visibility and proposed B2B marketing approaches, especially for the recreational sector.

🧭 Problem-Solving and Decision-Making
I identified key challenges Falcon faced and proposed actionable solutions, such as optimizing production methods and exploring cost-efficient materials. My goal was always to support the company in becoming a competitive cost leader.
